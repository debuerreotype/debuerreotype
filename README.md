# Debuerreotype

[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/debuerreotype/debuerreotype/workflows/GitHub%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/debuerreotype/debuerreotype/actions?query=workflow%3A%22GitHub+CI%22+branch%3Amaster)

Reproducible, [snapshot](https://snapshot.debian.org)-based Debian rootfs builds (especially for Docker).

This is based on [lamby](https://github.com/lamby)'s work for reproducible `debootstrap`:

### "Debuerreotype"?

The name is an attempt at riffing off the photography basis of the word "snapshot".  The [daguerreotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype) process was an early method for taking photographs, and this is a method for taking "photographs" of Debian at a given point in time.

## Why?

The goal is to create an auditable, reproducible process for creating rootfs tarballs (especially for use in Docker) of Debian releases, based on point-in-time snapshots from [snapshot.debian.org](https://snapshot.debian.org).

However, as noted below, the only strictly Docker-specific script is `debuerreotype-minimizing-config`, which applies many configuration tweaks which are useful for Docker users and may or may not be useful outside of that context.

## Usage

The usage of the scripts here center around a "rootfs" directory, which is both the working directory for building the target rootfs, and contains the `debuerreotype-epoch` file, which records our snapshot.debian.org epoch value (so we can adjust timestamps using it, as it is the basis for our reproducibility).

Available scripts:

| *script* | *purpose* |
| --- | --- |
| `debuerreotype-init` | create the initial "rootfs", given a suite and a timestamp (in some format `date(1)` can parse); `sources.list` will be pointing at snapshot.debian.org |
| `debuerreotype-chroot` | run a command in the given "rootfs" (using `unshare` to mount `/dev`, `/proc`, and `/sys` from the parent environment in a simple, safe way) |
| `debuerreotype-apt-get` | run `apt-get` via `debuerreotype-chroot`, including `-o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false` to account for older snapshots with (now) invalid `Valid-Until` values |
| `debuerreotype-minimizing-config` | apply configuration tweaks to make the rootfs minimal and keep it minimal (especially targeted at Docker images, with comments explicitly describing Docker use cases) |
| `debuerreotype-slimify` | remove files such as documentation to create an even smaller rootfs (used for creating `slim` variants of the Docker images, for example) |
| `debuerreotype-debian-sources-list` | generate an appropriate Debian `sources.list` in the rootfs given a suite (especially for updating `sources.list` to point at deb.debian.org before generating outputs) |
| `debuerreotype-recalculate-epoch` | (esp. for non-Debian) recalculate `debuerreotype-epoch` from `/var/lib/apt/lists/*_{In,}Release` files' `Date:` fields (after updating `sources.list` / `apt-get update`) |
| `debuerreotype-fixup` | invoked by `debuerreotype-tar` to fixup timestamps and remove known-bad log files for determinism |
| `debuerreotype-tar` | deterministically create a tar file of the rootfs |
| `debuerreotype-version` | print out the version of the current `debuerreotype` installation |

A simple `Dockerfile` is provided for using these scripts in a simple deterministic environment based on Docker, but given a recent enough version of `debootstrap`, they should run fine outside Docker as well (and their deterministic properties have been verified on at least a Gentoo host in addition to the provided Debian-based Docker environment).

The provided `Dockerfile` also includes comments with hints for bootstrapping the environment on a new architecture (which then presumably doesn't have a `debian` Docker base image yet).

Full example: (see [`examples/debian.sh`](examples/debian.sh) for this in practice)

```

(As a one-liner via [`docker-run.sh`](docker-run.sh): `./docker-run.sh sh -euxc 'debuerreotype-init --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-removed-keys.gpg /tmp/rootfs stretch 2017-01-01T00:00:00Z; debuerreotype-minimizing-config /tmp/rootfs; debuerreotype-apt-get /tmp/rootfs update -qq; debuerreotype-apt-get /tmp/rootfs dist-upgrade -yqq; debuerreotype-apt-get /tmp/rootfs install -yqq --no-install-recommends inetutils-ping iproute2; debuerreotype-debian-sources-list /tmp/rootfs stretch; debuerreotype-tar /tmp/rootfs - | sha256sum'`)

## How much have you verified this?

Well, I ran the scripts across seven explicit architectures (`amd64`, `arm64`, `armel`, `armhf`, `i386`, `ppc64el`, `s390x`) and eight explicit suites (`oldstable`, `stable`, `testing`, `unstable`, `wheezy`, `jessie`, `stretch`, `sid`) for a timestamp of `2017-05-16T00:00:00Z` (where supported, since `wheezy`/`oldstable` didn't or no longer currently supports some of those architectures), and there were no modifications to any of the tarballs after several runs across several days.

Additionally, GitHub Actions runs with a fixed timestamp value across several suites to verify that their checksums are reproducible, as expected.

From time to time, comments in the files generated by `debuerreotype-minimizing-config` might change (for example), which would obviously result in a different checksum, but a simple [`diffoscope`](https://diffoscope.org/) should be sufficient to verify that the change is benign.
